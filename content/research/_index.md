# Work in Progress

**Dust to Dust: Tracing Air Pollutionâ€™s Impact on Work Accidents** (with [Benjamin Hattemer](https://benjaminhattemer.com/))
##### *Presented at: Microeconometrics Working Group, EUI; Norges Bank; Institute for Labour Law and Industrial Relations in the European Union*

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    This study offers novel causal estimates of the effect of air pollution on workplace accidents. We focus on a near world-wide natural source of air pollution: dust precipitation. We use administrative data on the universe of work accidents reported in Spain. Our estimates imply that an average day of dust precipitation induces a 1.2 percent increase in work accidents. We find these effects are pervasive for workers of different occupations, income levels and demographic characteristics.
