## Work in Progress
- **Dust to Dust: Tracing Air Pollutionâ€™s Impact on Work Accidents** (with [Benjamin Hattemer](https://benjaminhattemer.com/)) [*Draft coming soon*]
- <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This study offers novel causal estimates of the effect of air pollution on workplace accidents. We focus on a near world-wide natural source of air pollution: dust precipitation. We use administrative data on the universe of work accidents reported in Spain.  Our estimates imply that an average day of dust precipitation induces a 1.2 percent increase in work accidents. We find these effects are pervasive for workers of different income levels. Effects are also significant for occupations of high and medium work-accident-risk, which employ 40 percent of the workforce.
