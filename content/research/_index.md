    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This study provides novel causal estimates of the effect of air pollution on workplace accidents. We focus on a near-worldwide natural source of air pollution: dust precipitation. We use administrative data on the universe of work accidents reported in Spain from 2010 to 2019. Our estimates reveal that a day of dust precipitation induces a 1.4 percent increase in work accidents, this corresponds to 40 percent of the impact of a day with extreme heat. We calculate the burden of dust precipitation corresponds to approximately one in every 400 workplace accidents.  Except for the highest wage quintile, impacts are significant for workers along the wage distribution. Effects in percentage terms are similar across occupations. However,  workers in high-risk jobs suffer an increase in per capita  accidents 22 times larger than workers in low-risk jobs. Increases in workplace accidents are observed across incidents of varying severity, including those requiring over two months of sick leave. The results are consistent with exposure to dust increasing the likelihood of human error across a broad range of tasks and activities.
